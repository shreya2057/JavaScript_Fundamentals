Asynchronous programming
-------------------------

->Asynchronous programming is s programming technique that allows programs 
  to start long running tasks and continue running other tasks in parallel.

->This is in contrast to synchronous programming where the program must 
  wait for a task to complete before moving to the next task.

->It is necessary as while requesting to server that us elsewhere can take
  time to return the data. While waiting, the program might have to do 
  some other task instead of waiting.


Asynchronous operation
----------------------

->Asynchronous operation refers to a task or process that does not block
  the execution of the main program or script.

->Instead it allows other code to run while it continues in the background
  and eventually complete
